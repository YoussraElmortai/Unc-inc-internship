## looping with css
For the Solutions page, I implemented an interactive hover effect using CSS that cycles through different colors. The styling logic:

- Uses `:nth-of-type()` pseudo-classes to target specific elements in sequence
- Applies distinct background colors to every 2nd, 3rd, and 4th element of their type

This approach creates a visually engaging pattern while maintaining consistent, programmatic styling rules.

```css
&:nth-of-type(2n) {
  background-color: rgb(220, 140, 238);
  top: 34%;
  left: 5%;
}

&:nth-of-type(3n) {
  background-color: rgb(140, 238, 199);
  top: 37%;
  left: 70%;
}

&:nth-of-type(4n) {
  background-color: rgb(163, 238, 140);
  top: 62%;
  left: 35%;
}
```
