# Unc inc Graduation Internship
## My time as a frontend intern
## The company
We design and develop digital platforms and apps to foster collaboration and create positive change.
n small, self-managing teams, we work together on big challenges. We actively involve our partners and end users, giving everyone the freedom to share ideas. This is how we continue to innovate and grow, learning from each other, every project and every collaboration, every day.

### The projects
During my internship, I was able to work on:
- The new UNC Inc. corporate website
- Netbeheer Nederland
- UNC Inc's Design system

### What I learned
I learned more about React and what itâ€™s like to work in a multidisciplinary team. It also gave me great insight into how working in sprints functions in practice.
