# Unc inc Graduation Internship
## My time as a frontend intern
## The company
During my internship at **UNC Inc.**, I had the opportunity to work with an innovative company that:

- Designs and develops digital platforms and applications to foster collaboration and drive positive change
- Operates in small, self-managing teams to tackle significant challenges
- Emphasizes active partnership involvement and end-user engagement
- Encourages open idea-sharing to fuel continuous innovation
- Maintains a culture of constant learning from every project and collaboration

This experience provided me with valuable insights into agile development processes and user-centered design methodologies.

### The projects
During my internship, I was able to work on:
- The new UNC Inc. corporate website
- Netbeheer Nederland
- UNC Inc's Design system

### What I learned
I learned more about React and what itâ€™s like to work in a multidisciplinary team. It also gave me great insight into how working in sprints functions in practice.
